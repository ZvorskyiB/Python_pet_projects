# Python pet projects  
My Python projects I was doing with purpose to practice: 
* Plotting with the libraries `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
* Statistics including:
     * hypothesis testing
     * a/b testing   

  with the libraries `scipy` and `bootstrapped` 
* Machine Learning tools such as:
     *  hierarchical clustering
     *  k-means clustering
     *  linear regression
     *  classification and regression trees
     *  random forest
     *  gradient boosting machine   
  
  with the libraries `sklearn` and `scipy`


## Worth attention

* I used service **Google Colab** as editor of my code. I don't know if my code work as good as it does in Colab
* I made a zip files of datasets I used in each of my projects but there easier is way to download the data if you Colab using commands such as `! gdown` and `!unzip`(if we need first to unzip file in order to take a csv). All the data are in my public folders in **Google Drive**, so you can use my jupyter notebooks in Colab without downloading datasets zip files from this repository locally in your computer.

 
## Next steps

I am going to learn new ML tools such as XGBoost, k-medoids clustering, optics clustering neural networks and more. And I will practice using them and push the jupyter notebooks here.
