# Python_pet_projects  
My python projects I was doing with purpose to practice: 
* Plotting in libraries `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
* Statistics such as:
     * hypothesis testing
     * a/b testing   

  in libraries `scipy` and `bootstrapped` 
* Machine Learning tools such as:
     *  hiearchical clustering
     *  k-means clustering
     *  linear regression
     *  classification and regression trees
     *  random forest
     *  gradient boosting machine   
  
  in libraries `sklearn` and `scipy`


## Worth attention

* I used service **Google Colab** as redactor of my code. I don't know if my code will work as useful as it does in Colab
* I made a zip files of datasets I used in each of my projects but there easier way to download the data if you Colab using comansd such as `! gdown` and `!unzip`(if we need first to unzip file in order to take a csv). All the data are in my public folders in **Google Drive**, so you can use my jupyter notebooks in Colab without downloading datasets zip files from this repository localy in your computer.

 
## Next steps

I am going to learn new ML tools such as XG boost, k-medoids clustering, optics clustering neural networks and more. And I will practice using them and push the jupyter notebooks here.
